<h1>TreeCmp: Comparison of Trees in Polynomial Time</h1>
<hr />
<p>TreeCmp implements metrics that can be calculated in polynomial time for arbitrary (not only bifurcating) trees: four metrics for unrooted trees (Matching Split metric, which we have recently proposed, Robinson-Foulds, path difference, quartet) and four metrics for rooted trees which are similar to them (Matching Cluster metric, Robinson-Foulds cluster metric, nodal splitted and triples). TreeCmp offers an implementation of some of these metrics with better computational efficiency than available tools, allowing to compare trees with a large number of leaves. We also propose a way to obtain normalized distances between trees, which indicate whether two trees are more dissimilar than two random trees with the same number of leaves according to a given metric.</p>
<p>TreeCmp in version 1.0-b291 can be download  as a zip archive: <a href="bin/TreeCmp_v1.0-b291.zip" >TreeCmp_v1.0-b291.zip</a> together with a short manual <a href="doc/TreeCmp_manual.pdf" >TreeCmp_manual.pdf</a>.
In order to unpack the file any software supporting zip compression, for example free software 7-zip (<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" >http://www.7-zip.org/</a>), can be used.
TreeCmp is a command line tool written in pure Java. Java VM in version at least 1.5 is required to properly run TreeCmp 1.0.

<p>
The latest version of TreeCmp is <a href="bin/TreeCmp_v1.1-b308.zip" >TreeCmp_v1.1-b308</a>. This version contains implementation of a new metric - the Matching Pair (MP) distance. TreeCmp 1.1 requires Java 1.6 (aka Java 6).
